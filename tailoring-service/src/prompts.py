MY MASTER RESUME (compact format):
{master_resume_json}

PREVIOUSLY GENERATED SUMMARY:
{generated_summary}

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Keep work entries in chronological order (do NOT reorder)
- You MUST generate an array of work entries that exactly matches the number of entries in the master resume.
- For EACH work entry, you MUST generate BOTH fields: "summary" AND "highlights"
- CRITICAL: Every single work entry must have a "summary" string AND a "highlights" array with 2-3 bullet points
- Summary: max 2 sentences, ~40 words
- Highlights: max 3 bullets, ~15 words each
- CRITICAL: Work summary MUST be concise. Do NOT ramble. Do NOT repeat phrases. Stop at 2 sentences maximum.
- BAD example: "Managed the end-to-end SDLC and product strategy for diverse portfolios, including the launch of AI-native products and a consumer-facing Live Shopping MVP application. Collaborated closely with cross-functional engineering, analytics, and business teams to ship high-impact features and client releases within strict SLAs constraint factors and tight schedules..." (TOO LONG, RAMBLING)
- GOOD example: "Led product strategy for AI-native telecom products and consumer-facing MVPs. Collaborated with cross-functional teams to ship high-impact features within SLAs." (2 sentences, ~25 words)
- Do NOT include company, position, startDate, endDate - these are static (preserved from master resume)
- Ensure consistency with the previously generated summary
